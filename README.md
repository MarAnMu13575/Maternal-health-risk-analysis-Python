# Maternal Health Risk Analysis with Python

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze maternal health risk data collected from different hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health cares through an IoT-based risk monitoring system. The dataset includes various attributes related to pregnant patients, such as age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, heart rate, and the predicted risk intensity level during pregnancy.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

- **Age**: Age of the pregnant woman in years.
- **SystolicBP**: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, a significant attribute during pregnancy.
- **DiastolicBP**: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another important attribute during pregnancy.
- **BS**: Blood glucose levels in terms of a molar concentration (mmol/L).
- **HeartRate**: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
- **Risk Level**: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy, considering the previous attributes.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to predict health risks for pregnant patients based on the provided data attributes. By understanding which health conditions are strong indications for health risks during pregnancy, we can develop better monitoring and care strategies to improve maternal health outcomes.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and clean the data, handle missing values and outliers if any.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of each attribute and their relationship with the risk level.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most significant attributes that strongly indicate health risks during pregnancy.

4. **Risk Prediction Model**: Build a predictive model to determine the health risk level based on the selected features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics.
